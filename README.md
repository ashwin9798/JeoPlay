# Jeopardy-Parse-Play
An iOS app using scraped data from J-Archive for questions and answers and the Apple Speech Framework for voice recognition (interactive gameplay)

Using Kanna and Alamofire, I parsed and scraped J-Archive data to create a Jeopardy game using voice recognition using the Apple Speech Framework. I found such a game to be more fun than the multiple choice games currently available. I have started to add multiplayer capability using Firebase.
