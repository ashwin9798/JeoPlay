# Jeopardy- Parse & Play

Prepare for Jeopardy!

This is an iOS app using scraped data from J-Archive for questions and answers and the Apple Speech Framework for voice recognition (interactive gameplay).

Using Kanna and Alamofire, I parsed and scraped J-Archive data to create a Jeopardy game using voice recognition using the Apple Speech Framework. I found such a game to be more fun than the multiple choice games currently available. I have started to add multiplayer capability using Firebase.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository, install the necessary CocoaPods using the 'pod install' command.

2. Connect your device to your laptop, and transfer the app onto the phone through XCode.

3. Enjoy your Jeopardy gameplay preparation!
